# media_query
##Welcome to media query practice page.

This is a practice exercise created to work with the basics of CSS media query functions.

Paul-Hess created these files while a student at Epicodus Coding Bootcamp.
You can see the effect of the media query functions and how they update the layout of the page by manually making your screen smaller or by opening the page in Chrome and in the console (cmd-option-J on MAC) clicking the mobile icon. This will open a new console that renders the screen as it would be seen on various popular mobile devices.

Media queries also create options for making your webpage eminantly printable. You can see how this page is optmized for color-ink saving and paper-readability by opening a print preview in your of it in your browser (cmd-P on MAC).
